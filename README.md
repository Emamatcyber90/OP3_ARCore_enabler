# OnePlus 3 ARCore enabler
A Magisk module that enables ARCore support for OnePlus 3 and allows you to install apps with ARCore support via Play Store.

# How does this module work?
It changes OnePlus 3 fingerprint to OnePlus 3T one, which is supported officially by ARCore, so apps will think your phone is a OnePlus 3T.

The module also adds a xml so that Play Store will allow you to look for apps that support ARCore and install ARCore itself.

# Recomandations
1. Clear Play Store data after installing the module, otherwise Play Store won't notice the changes;
2. If you are an Oxygen OS user, it's raccomanded to disable the module before installing OTA updates.

# Downloads
- [ARCore app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=it): if you search it in Play Store you won't find it, but with this link can be installed properly;
- [Playground](https://f.celsoazevedo.com/file/gcamera/ar/ARStickers_All_Pack_V1.5build-1.3.180720036.apk): original Playground works just on Pixel devices and force closes on other devices, but with this modded version by Arnova8G2 you won't have problems.
