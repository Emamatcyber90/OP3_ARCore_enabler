## THIS MODULE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED, AS [THE MODULE WITH WITH PIXEL 2 FINGERPRINT](https://github.com/MarcAnt01/OP3_ARCore_enabler) DOES THE SAME THING AND THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE OF DEVELOPING TWO THINGS THAT DO THE SAME STUFF ##

# OnePlus 3 ARCore enabler
A Magisk module that enables ARCore support for OnePlus 3 and allows you to install apps with ARCore support via Play Store.

# How does this module work?
It changes OnePlus 3 fingerprint to OnePlus 3T one, which is supported officially by ARCore, so apps will think your phone is a OnePlus 3T.

The module also adds a xml so that Play Store will allow you to look for apps that support ARCore and install ARCore itself.

# Recomandations
1. Clear Play Store data after installing the module, otherwise Play Store won't notice the changes;
2. If you are an Oxygen OS user, it's raccomanded to disable the module before installing OTA updates;
3. Security patches info in system settings won't show the right phone patches, but the fingerprint one after installing the module

# Downloads
You can find the link to download the module, ARCore, some other apps and instruction [in this page](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/ar/).
